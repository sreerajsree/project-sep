            <p>
                On 31st March 2021, we have filed Investigation new drug application (INDA) for our in-house first in class
                anti-diabetic molecule. We have successfully completed Phase 1 trials and results are very encouraging.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                As on 31st Dec 2023, we are working on two New Chemical Entity (NCE) molecule for Autoimmune diseases and
                Oncology and both are in preclinical phase of development. We have also developed novel repurposed drug for
                non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                We are developing novel drug delivery systems for inhalation solutions and pulmonary drug delivery,
                including dry-powder inhalers, metered-dose inhalers and oral films. In addition, we are strengthening our
                capabilities in product portfolios such as NCEs and Paragraph IV products. Further, our biotechnology team
                is in the process of developing several biosimilars (including monoclonal antibodies) for anti-allergic and
                anti-cancer treatments.
